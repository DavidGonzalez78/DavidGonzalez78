## Academic Projects

### ◇ [House pricing data pipeline and prediction](https://github.com/DavidGonzalez78/House-pricing-data-pipeline-and-prediction)
End-to-end data engineering and ML pipeline for housing price prediction in Barcelona. Covers data ingestion, cleaning, standardization, feature engineering, outlier handling and predictive modeling, using Python, Spark, MongoDB, MLflow and Airflow.


### ◇ [Aircrafts Data Warehouse ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/DavidGonzalez78/Aircrafts-ETL-project)
Design and implementation of an ETL pipeline to centralize and restructure an airport-related database. The project includes data cleaning, transformation and UML design, significantly improving the efficiency of obtaining key performance indicators.



### ◇ [Liver Patient Classification with Machine Learning](https://github.com/DavidGonzalez78/Liver-patients-classification-ML)
Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of a liver patient dataset, followed by the training and comparison of several supervised machine learning models (LDA, QDA, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM). Model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics, laying the groundwork for a potential clinical decision support system.



### ◇ [Multivariate Data Analysis in R](https://github.com/DavidGonzalez78/Automobile-Multivariate-Data-Analysis-R)
Multivariate analysis of an automobile dataset using dimensionality reduction techniques, clustering methods and discriminant analysis. The project focuses on identifying complex patterns and relationships between vehicle characteristics.



### ◇ [Implementation of a Support Vector Machine from Scratch](https://github.com/DavidGonzalez78/Support-Vector-Machine-from-scratch-AMPL/tree/main)
Implementation of a Support Vector Machine from scratch, solving both its primal and dual optimization problems in AMPL and applying the kernel trick. The implementation was validated using multiple datasets.
